# BGD-G3

There are four separate folders.

1) The input folder contains one zipped folder. The zipped folder has two separate CSV files. The CSV files are weekly and monthly aggregated datasets.

2) The Processing folder contains the file called Modelling.ipynb. This file contains separate regression models for the weekly and monthly aggregated data. Simple and clear   comments are associated along with the code snippets.

3) The Output folder contains results of the regression model. The results are listed inside the folder.

4) The sql.txt in the SQL folder includes queries we used to preprocess different datasets used for our analysis.

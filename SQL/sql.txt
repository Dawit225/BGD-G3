Because of lacking previlege to work on the public schema such as deleting records and altering attributes,
we first copy some tables from the public schema to our personal schema.
       
1) create table 23357335.myblock as
   select * from public.block;

2) create table s2257335.mybservation as 
select * from public.observation
where obsdate BETWEEN '2017-01-01' and '2017-06-30'



--- For the block table---

Cheking for the duplicated records (latit and longit)

SELECT block, latit, longit, geom FROM block WHERE (latit, longit) IN
  (SELECT latit, longit FROM block GROUP BY (latit, longit) HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)

Filtering out the duplicates

select distinct on (longit, latit) *
from myblock

Delete the blocks outside the Netherlands (2 blocks)

DELETE FROM myblock
WHERE block = 44643 and longit = 249 and latit = 0 and urlnr = '870169';
                                    &&
DELETE FROM myblock
WHERE block = 44644 and longit = 254 and latit = 0 and urlnr = '870170';

Creating new table and ingest records without duplicates

create table s2257335.myblock as 
select distinct on (longit, latit) *
from public.block
